<p>*COVID-19 is a disease caused by coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and was discovered in December 2019.</p>
<p>*Fever, cough, congestion, shortness of breath, chills, muscle aches, and loss of taste or smell are all common symptoms of COVID-19.</p>
<p>*After being exposed to the virus, these symptoms might last anywhere from 2 to 14 days. COVID-19 is a virus that causes mild symptoms in many people. You may feel as if you have a flu or a cold as a result of these symptoms. Some people, on the other hand, have mild symptoms while others have severe ones. COVID-19 can be lethal in some situations.</p>
<p>Inhaling respiratory droplets in the air is the most common way to get COVID-19. When a person with COVID-19 breathes, coughs, or sneezes, tiny droplets of virus leave the air through their mouth and nose. These drops are invisible to you. You might inhale those droplets if you're within 6 feet of that person.</p>
